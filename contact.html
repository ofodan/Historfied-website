    A thousand historic events happened in the territorial space called Nigeria long before she marked her gloried Independence, until present day. Several history books have tried, without fail, to coherently compile the stories of these iconic events.

    No one could do a decent job of it, until we came along!
    
     Historified is an animation series that simplifies Nigerian History in a fun, spirited way, without compromising the facts. Every Episode is packed with unexpectedly-witty anecdotes, exaggerated mannerisms and hilariously-sassy conversations.
    
     Learn about major historical events in Nigeria that no academic institution is willing to teach!
